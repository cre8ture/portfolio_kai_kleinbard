export const bio = `I'm a computer and data scientist who loves to use deep learning and big language models to make things that are easy to use and friendly. I started Somatikai, a place where I explore how AI and body awareness can work together. I also run bodyLITERATE, an organization that helps people who learn differently. And I created The Institute for Playful Beings and PlayLab, where I play with different ways of being and learning. I have a Masters Degree from UPenn, where I studied how to make digital tools more accessible for neuro-diverse learners. I also know how to mediate conflicts between families and schools, thanks to Good Shepherd Services. And I learned Motivational Interviewing, a kind of therapy, from William R Miller, who invented it. Besides all that, I'm still a dancer and a martial artist at heart.`;
